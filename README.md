Slides and calculations for the presentation about hydro energy presented during the future energy supply and nuclear fusion seminar ([PHYS6337.1](https://campusonline.uni-ulm.de/qislsf/rds?state=wsearchv&search=1&P.vx=mittel&veranstaltung.veranstnr=PHYS6337.1&language=en)) in the Winter semester 19-20 at [Ulm University](https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/).

Slides are available in [OpenDocument](https://github.com/iyanmv/ESN_ws19-20/raw/master/Hydro_energy.odp) (`.odp`) format or in [PDF](https://github.com/iyanmv/ESN_ws19-20/raw/master/Hydro_energy.pdf). For the former, please open it with [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (>=6.2.8).

Calculations and results are presented in two [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. You can view the notebooks files (`.ipynb`) direclty on github by clicking on them, download them and open them locally (check [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)) or you can also execute them online using Binder:

* **Global numbers**: :notebook: [Notebook](Global.ipynb) (just results) | :cloud: [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iyanmv/ESN_ws19-20/master?filepath=Global.ipynb) (run online)
* **Estimation for Germany**: :notebook: [Notebook](Estimation_Germany.ipynb) (just results) | :cloud: [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iyanmv/ESN_ws19-20/master?filepath=Estimation_Germany.ipynb) (run online)
